        "\n",
        "1.  **Delivery Timeliness is the Most Critical Factor:** The analysis confirms that **delivery timeliness is the single most significant predictor of customer review scores**. Both the exploratory data analysis (boxplots, correlation matrix) and the formal hypothesis test provide strong evidence for this. Late deliveries are consistently associated with low review scores (1-2 stars).\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **Product Category and Price Have Less Impact:** While there are minor variations in average review scores across different product categories and price points, **the effect of a late delivery is far more pronounced and consistent across all categories**. A customer is more likely to be unhappy about a late, cheap item than an on-time, expensive one.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **Most Orders Are Delivered Early:** A positive finding is that the vast majority of orders are delivered well ahead of their estimated schedule. This suggests the issue is not a systemic failure but may be concentrated in specific regions, with certain carriers, or during particular time periods."

        "\n",
        "**Recommendation 1: Focus operational improvements on the logistics pipeline.**\n",
        "Olist should review carrier performance and set more accurate delivery estimates, especially for remote regions, as this is the primary cause of customer dissatisfaction. A deeper analysis could identify underperforming carriers or routes, allowing for targeted interventions.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Recommendation 2: Implement a proactive customer communication strategy.**\n",
        "For orders that are projected to be late, Olist should automatically notify the customer of the delay. This transparency can manage expectations and reduce frustration. Coupling this notification with a small gesture, such as a discount on a future purchase, could help mitigate the negative experience and retain the customer."
